This is the code in Matlab associated with the manuscript:
"Ecological models: higher complexity in, higher feasibility out" by
Mohammad AlAdwani,Serguei Saavedra. J. Roy. Soc. Interface

We provide two examples, one for 2 species and a second one for 3 species.
To run the code you additionally need to
(1) download PHCpack libraries from http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/PHClab1.0.4.tar.gz
(2) add add into the folder the exec file: http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html
(3) run the code inside the folder where you saved PHCpack libraries

The code provides the number of free-equilibrium points and the probability of feasibility. The code is fully commented for its use and potential extensions
